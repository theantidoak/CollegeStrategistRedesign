# CollegeStrategistRedesign
For AcademicInfluence.com

This is a demonstration of how I would improve a the page, 'College Strategist', on AcademicInfluence.com. I added svg icons to the first section, split up the writing, and highlighted the affirmation tip.

In the second section, the form, I made it a bit more playful and gave it a standalone look.

For the last section, I turned the grid into a carousel. Originally, it did not seem as responsive as it could be since the school names were crossing the borders when the screensize was small.

The svg icons were taken from either feathericons.com or Google Icons, except for the select input svg icons, which I made. 

The gender input are radio buttons restyled using svgs.
